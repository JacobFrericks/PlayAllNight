This is an application that I created for my wife because she had a need that we couldn’t find in any other app. She has an issue where she can’t sleep without some static noise or music playing in the background. We found an awesome track that puts her right to sleep (the static noise wasn’t working for her). The problem is that when it turns off, she is wide awake. So I started looking for an application that could play music until a certain time. We found one, but it wasn’t very convenient. It had a sleep function, but it only incremented by 5 min. In other words, if she wanted a full nights sleep, we would have to press the “+5 minutes” button about 96 times before we got the time we wanted. So I created this app.

It is worth noting, that this app will never reach the Play Store. I decided it wasn’t worth the $25 to upload, and it also allowed me to put the track directly into the assets folder, so we won’t have to keep track of it. This app used to be native, but was recently redone to be in React Native.
